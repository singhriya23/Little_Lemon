### Meta's "[Principles of UX/UI Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-ux-ui-design?specialization=meta-front-end-developer#modules)" course on Coursera

This is my first wireframe and protoype I've created, and it's also my final assignment for Meta's 5 week "Principles of UX/UI Design" course that's part of their Front-End Developer Professional Certificate program.

### Reflection
Things to improve in the future:

* Enable interactivity for the back button, as well.
* Figure out how to add a radio button.
* Correct "Date" on the input form to a drop-down. 
* Be more precise when it comes to details like small, self-created vectors: the vector on the "Seating location" does not match the one in "Date".
* Correct spelling: instances of "Seating location"; one spelled with capital "l", the other with lower-case "l".
* The provided input field width by the course is is not wide enough for real-life scenarios.
* More in-depth prototypes should also include designing the drop-down menu in further detail.
